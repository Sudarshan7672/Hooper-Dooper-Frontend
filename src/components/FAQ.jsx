                  We call it "convertible bike" and few companies offer
                  convertible balance bike option, and we thought as well. But
                  bike with 12" wheel become very uncomfortable for growing
                  kids, so providing convertible option on 12" really doent make
                  sense. So best option is to have balance bike from age 2 to 4
                  and buy pedal bike of 16"-20" wheel size after that.

                  We recommend, balance bike start age around 2-3, as it
                  increase usability of balance bike and also height of balance
                  bike is in proper range. 5 year kids would be too tall for

                  The lightweight bike starts in balance bike mode. Then, when

                  and chain in one go. ... When a child rides a balance bike,
                  their feet need to be flat on the floor, with a slight bend in
                  the knee. This allows them to move the bike along safely

                  Opinions differ regarding requirement of brakes. but it is
                  agreed that children of 2-5 age group often fail to apply
                  brakes when required. Instead, fastest and natural response
                  child can give in event of over speeding is rubbing feet on
                  the ground to stop the vehicle. In balance bike it is possible
                  as riders feet can touch ground due to low seat height.
                  Stopping action by rubbing feet on ground is more effective
                  and stable as child do not lose control due to excessive force
                  on one side. It is observed that, adults too tend to rub their
                  feet on ground to stop the vehicle in sudden requirement, and
                  most of the time it happened naturally.

                  Training wheels may encourage the rider to learn some behavior
                  which later must be unlearned. Second, presence of training
                  wheel put sever restriction on the turning and speed taking
                  away all bicycle riding fun. After certain period training
                  wheel wobble or one side inclination takes away the confidence
                  of child to drive it independently. Balance bikes allow the
                  child to drop their feet to the ground when they feel they are
                  losing balance, quickly steadying themselves and preventing a
                  fall.

                  With a balance bicycle, the rider learns balance first, pedal
                  last. In contrast, with a normal bicycle fitted with training
                  wheels, the rider learns pedal first, balance last. Although
                  opinions differs, but it is generally agreed that a bicycle
                  with pedals is too difficult for most very young children and
                  that training wheels may encourage the rider to learn some
                  behaviors which later must be unlearned. A child’s physical
                  ability such as balance, steering and coordination are
                  acquired faster on the balance Bike than on a bike equipped
                  with training wheels and pedal. Most important thing is lack
                  of fear factor. Child’s feet can touch to the ground and hence
                  they feel very safe compared to while riding bicycle, which
                  boost their confidence and take away fear or dislike about two
                  wheel concept.

                  Learning to ride a bicycle is one of life’s milestones and
                  first step to gaining true independence. Balance Bike gives
                  true independence along with huge boost in confidence. Low
                  seat height and ultra-light weight is main reason behind
                  success of balance bike. Low seat height allow the child to
                  drop their feet to the ground when they feel they are losing
                  balance, quickly steadying themselves and preventing a fall
                  which give sense of being in complete control and take away
                  the fear of falling down. Its ultra light weight make sure
                  that they will not get injured. Just making a fundamental
                  change i.e. removing pedal makes balance bike a perfect gift
                  for kid age 2-5. Up and down movement of pedalling of normal
                  bicycle causes the child to shift their body weight from side
                  to side throwing them off balance making them lose direction
                  and riding stability. Added to it child’s feet cannot touch on
                  ground which create lack of confidence about driving it
                  independently and create fear or dislike about the two wheel
                  concept. This makes bicycle not suitable for 2-5 year kids and
                  hence in balance bike pedal is removed which not only make it
                  simple and light weight but a true enjoyable toy with hours of
                  quality fun.

                  learning balancing just in a week and steering form first day
                  …riding fast from one corner to another… showing you new stunt
                  every day……seeing him driving independently without any
                  assistance… It might seems that initial cost is high, but
                  there is no cost as it is complete maintenance free product.
