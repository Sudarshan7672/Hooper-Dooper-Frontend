Size has to be small so that the child can rest his/her feet on the ground. It takes a couple of days for the child to get hang of it. Best fun is if you've a gentle slope available for the child's to play. Prompt delivery, good communication, easy assembly & decent quality product.",

I was sold on learning to balance first and then pedal later without training wheels. And I looked at foreign and domestic versions before I settled on this.",
